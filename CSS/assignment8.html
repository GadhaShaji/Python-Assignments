<div>
	CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,<br> including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation<br> characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.<br>
</div>

<div>

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods,<br> such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),<br> and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

<div>
	The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine<br> which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). <br>Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]<br>
